- Quickly reference the rules of the game
- Resume playing a game that you may have put on pause temporarily


# Project Details
- Currently live on the playstore.  View it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.rjreid.wizardcompanion
- This project was created because my friends and family and I play the Wizard card game quite often and I wanted an easier way to keep score.  There are a couple of apps and websites out there that do this already, but I thought I could do a better job.
- I wanted a project to play around with Jetpack Compose, Datastore, flows, etc. and this project provided that.  I am a fan of compose for sure.
